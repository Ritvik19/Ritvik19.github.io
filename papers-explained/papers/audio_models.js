            "Addresses the limited research on pretraining systems on large-scale datasets for audio pattern recognition and transferring them to other audio-related tasks. Trained on AudioSet, which contains 1.9 million audio clips with an ontology of 527 sound classes. Explores various convolutional neural network architectures, including a proposed Wavegram-Logmel-CNN that uses both log-mel spectrogram and waveform as input features.",
