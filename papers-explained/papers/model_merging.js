The study found that task-vector based merging, effectively reduced response length by ~50% while maintaining or slightly improving accuracy on 7B parameter models; activation-based merging showed even greater promise but is sensitive to calibration data; and merging efficacy was correlated with model scale, with smaller models struggling to learn complex reasoning and larger models posing challenges for significant length reduction.",
